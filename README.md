# Punchout

This code utilizes a combined neural network of DQN and CNN to process information from the Punch-Out game screen and predict the keys to be pressed. It integrates real-time screen capture, neural network training with Q-Learning, and action exploration/expansion. The autonomous system is efficient and capable of controlling the game.

Objective: The objective of this code was to develop a system that captures information from the Punch-Out game screen, processes this information using a neural network combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and then predicts the key to be pressed at the current moment of the game.

Screen Information Capture: The code includes features to capture Punch-Out game screen information in real-time. For this, I used libraries such as PIL, pytesseract, and pygetwindow for screen capture and image processing to extract relevant game data.

Image Preprocessing: Images captured from the game screen are preprocessed to prepare them for input into the neural network. I used cropping, resizing, normalization, and other preprocessing techniques to improve the quality of input data.

Neural Network Architecture: The code implements a neural network architecture that combines elements of DQN and CNN. The CNN part is responsible for extracting useful features from the game screen images, while the DQN part is responsible for making decisions based on these features.

Neural Network Training: The neural network is trained using the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm, where the network learns to associate game states (represented by screen images) with actions (keys to be pressed). During training, the network is exposed to various game situations and adjusts its weights to maximize expected rewards.

Exploration and Exploitation: During training, the neural network balances between exploring new actions and exploiting actions based on a defined exploration policy (e.g., Îµ-greedy). This allows the network to discover new strategies while still leveraging acquired knowledge.

Key Prediction: After training, the neural network can predict the key to be pressed based on the current game screen input. This is achieved using the trained architecture to map game states to actions.

Integration with the Game: The code can be directly integrated with the Punch-Out game, allowing it to capture real-time screen information and send keyboard commands to autonomously control the game.

Performance Evaluation: The system's performance is evaluated through metrics such as success rate in executing correct moves, score achieved in the game, or other relevant metrics for the Punch-Out game context.

Hyperparameter Optimization and Tuning: To improve system performance, the code may include features to optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, neural network size, training batch size, among others.

Documentation and Comments: The code is accompanied by detailed documentation and explanatory comments to facilitate understanding and maintenance by other developers.

Efficiency Considerations: The code is optimized to ensure computational efficiency, especially during real-time image capture and processing, as well as during neural network training.

Conclusion: In summary, the code implements a sophisticated system that uses a combination of DQN and CNN to make autonomous decisions in the Punch-Out game, capturing screen information, processing it, and predicting appropriate actions to be taken in real-time. This system demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and computer vision techniques in a gaming context.
